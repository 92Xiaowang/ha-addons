## Whatâ€™s changed

We want to reduce the complexity of this add-on and acknowledge the new possibilities for Managed Tunnels in the Cloudflare Dashboard with the next releases.

Therefore, we want to validate the necessity of some of the add-on options and kindly ask everyone to participate in [this very quick survey](https://github.com/brenner-tobias/addon-cloudflared/discussions/191). Thank you all very much!

We already started with some simplifications:

## ðŸš¨ Breaking changes

- Remove "reset-cloudflared_files" and "quick_tunnel" options @brenner-tobias (#192)

## ðŸ“š Documentation

- Update docs with mentions of security @AlecRust (#189)
