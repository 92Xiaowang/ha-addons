## What’s changed

Please be aware that the options 'custom_config', 'data_folder' and 'warp_*' within the add-on are deprecated and will be removed soon. We suggest to migrate to Cloudflare Managed tunnels as soon as possible to use these ingress rules.

## 🐛 Bug fixes

- set data path for default migration @brenner-tobias (#213)
