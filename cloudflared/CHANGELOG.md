## Whatâ€™s changed

We want to reduce the complexity of this add-on and acknowledge the new possibilities for Managed Tunnels in the Cloudflare Dashboard with the next releases.

Therefore, we want to validate the necessity of some of the add-on options and kindly ask everyone to participate in [this very quick survey](https://github.com/brenner-tobias/addon-cloudflared/discussions/191). Thank you all very much!

## ðŸš€ Enhancements

- Change order of configCheck, skip checks if running with custom_config @brenner-tobias (#193)
