## What’s changed

## 🚨 New functionality
We now support the use of remotely set up tunnels with this add-on.
Take a look at the [documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/tunnel-guide/#set-up-a-tunnel-remotely-dashboard-setup) to see if the new feature is for you and if you want to migrate your tunnel to the new functionality. The current set up process (local managed tunnel) is still fully supported by this add-on. **The update has no effect on existing configurations.**

## 🚀 Enhancements

- Add remote managed tunnel functionality: The new function allows to use remote managed Cloudflare tunnel with this add-on. @elcajon (#95)
